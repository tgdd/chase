The type def for fol formulas is in fol-parse-print (hmm...)

Seems that fol-models.ml and fol-syntax are  superfluous now -
incorporated into chase.ml

parsing + printing used to use lib.ml -- but no more?

.ocamlinit uses parseprint and also lib

older 
=====
lib.ml is from Harrison

fol-parse-print and fol-utils also (with some tweaks)

main.ml implements the chase over abstract "models", just sets of facts, with closed sequents.

models.ml is a smarter implmentation of models

TODO: lift the chase to thi better notion of models and sequents
