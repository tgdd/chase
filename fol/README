Use in your project by creating a symbolic link into where you would put the FOL
directory. That way ocamlbuild will handle building things correctly without any
extra work.

E.g. For a project structure like

+-+- fol/
| +- FolSyntax.ml
| +- ...
|
+-+- project/
+-+- fol/    <-- symbol link
+-+- ...

Where fol/ is created by executing the following in the project/ directory
ln -s ../fol fol
